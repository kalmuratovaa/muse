            <h3>MUSE</h3>
            <h4>The History of the MUSE through the Epochs</h4>
            <hr class="red-hr" color="red">
            <p>
                The history of the MUSE fashion House began in 1946 in a small mansion on Montaigne Street in Paris, where a young and enthusiastic designer Christian opened his atelier. Here, in February <br> 1947, he presented to the fashionable public
                the famous New Look collection with flared skirts and an accentuated waist. The new <br>silhouette became a revolution in the ascetic post-war fashion. <br> "I created a flower woman," the designer said. MUSE <br> brought back the desire
                to please women, taught them to attract attention to their <br> beauty. Critics scolded him for the wasteful use of fabrics (the designer's muse and <br> beloved client Princess Margaret was at one time forbidden to wear the brand's clothes).
                <br> However, discontent did not prevent the expansion of the fashion empire. In 1948, the boutique of <br> the House appeared in New York, and a year later MUSE licensed accessories, furs and bags <br> under its own name. It is noteworthy
                that throughout his career in the fashion house,<br> MUSE himself was only an employee - his brand de jure belonged to investor Marcel Boussac. <br> In the first collection of the spring-summer 1958 season, called "Trapezoids", the designer
                slightly <br> relaxed the body-binding styles that dominated Christian, and introduced a completely <br> new, trapezoidal silhouette.

                <span class="read-more-text">
                    "Muse and I". In his autobiography, the fashion designer claimed that there are two Christian people
                    and a myth. The first is none other than Christian himself, the second is the image of the great
                    couturier, born together with the fashion house in 1947.
                    In his first Dior Homme collection, art director Kim Jones interprets the aesthetics of the founder
                    of Dior in his own way. It simultaneously pays homage to the personality of the fashion designer and
                    his Haute Couture style, the quintessence of luxury and dreams. The collection is built as a
                    dialogue between the two lives of the artist.
                    Haute couture influenced the technology and the choice of fabrics, such as the "Tual de Jouy", which
                    decorated the historic Dior boutique at Avenue Montaigne, 30 in the design of Victor Granpierre.
                    Traditional Dior motifs are presented in the form of compositions of feathers, jacquard patterns and
                    embroidery on contrasting materials such as tulle and leather.
                    The designer translated the feminine aesthetics of Haute Couture into the language of men's
                    wardrobe, creating clothes with rounded shoulders and smooth clean lines. A scarf collar with a
                    ragged effect on shirts emphasizes the curve of the neck. The new "diagonal" Dior jacket, named
                    Tailleur Oblique, gently covers the silhouette, recalling the models of the autumn-winter 1950
                    collection.
                    Other jackets made of summer cashmere and mohair echo the products made of English woolen fabrics,
                    which Christian Dior especially appreciated and often used in collections and in life. Equally
                    exquisitely, Kim Jones combines elements of Haute Couture and sporty style, intertwining tradition
                    and modernity.
                    Numerous floral motifs of the collection tell about Christian Dior's love for nature and "flower
                    women". The floral pattern of one of the designer's porcelain sets was modernized and then
                    reproduced on clothes in the form of prints and embroidery. The embroidery of feathers with vinyl
                    coating by the Lemarié workshop also resembles the finest lacquer porcelain. The palette of the
                    collection is directly connected with the childhood of Christian Dior, whose tastes were formed
                    under the influence of the Edwardian era and the XVIII century. The catwalk is dominated by blue,
                    white, but also light pink - the color of the Dior family villa in Granville – and gray, one of the
                    designer's favorite shades. At the sight of yellow-gold inclusions, it is impossible not to recall
                    the words of Jean Cocteau about Christian Dior: "This is a genius with a light hand, in the spirit
                    of our time, his magical name consists of two words: Dieu (God) and Or (Gold)."
                    The spring-summer 2019 collection is filled with allusions to Christian Dior's personal life. The
                    leitmotif of the show is his dog Bobby, in whose honor a limited edition of the Miss Dior fragrance
                    was once released. Unusual details of jewelry are the seal of the Dior family company of the 1920s
                    and an embroidered symbol from a postcard announcing the birth of Christian Dior in 1905. This
                    immersion into the personal, intimate has also affected the choice of tailoring technologies:
                    jackets seem to be turned inside out - so that the striped lining and two types of silk organza are
                    visible, one of which reminds of the world of sports. At the same time, all models are invariably
                    imbued with the spirit of Haute Couture.
                    The influence of Dior's unique heritage has not spared accessories. The iconic Saddle bag is
                    presented for the first time in the men's version: in the form of a waist bag and a shoulder bag, as
                    well as in the form of a patch on backpacks and leather jackets. For the manufacture of accessories,
                    Dior's characteristic materials were used: an embroidered fabric "Tual de Jouy" with a Cannage motif
                    cut using a laser and a new tricolor fabric Dior Oblique.
                    Christian Dior wrote that several personalities get along in him. Taking advantage of this idea, Kim
                    Jones surrounded himself with creative people working in a variety of fields.
                    Yun, the co-founder of the Japanese brand Ambush, turned some Dior symbols into jewelry: insects,
                    the initials "CD" and flowers. In turn, Matthew Williams created a new metal buckle for accessories,
                    and the designer of hats Stephen Jones designed hats, taking as a basis the original models of
                    "Christian Dior Monsieur" from the archives of the fashion house. Specially invited artist KAWS
                    created a monumental replica of his iconic sculpture BFF for the show's scenery. The statue,
                    completely covered with roses, in whose hands you can see a bottle of Miss Dior with the image of
                    Bobby the dog, symbolizes the silhouette of Christian Dior. Another Dior symbol – a bee interpreted
                    by KAWS on prints and embroideries - illustrates his words: "It is impossible to make a mistake when
                    you draw inspiration from nature itself."
                    The personality of the fashion designer and his passion for nature set a new trajectory. Not just a
                    new image – a new look.
